# Obtaining the Data
Our data was pulled from the CDC's WONDER search tool, which provides access to the CDC's public information. The data is gathered through the U.S. birth registration system and does not include births occurring to U.S. citizens or residents outside the United States. Our dataset tracks births from the years 2016 to 2021.
